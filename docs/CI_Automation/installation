Requirements:
-------------
   - You must have read the Readme file FIRST!
   - You must have SUDO privileges
   - python version 3. Ideally python3.8+
   - Must have a python3 symbolic link in the /usr/bin folder
   - pip install python-dotenv pre-commit
   - Linux OS (No Windows support)
   - Install nginx, git, wget on your Linux server
   - DHCP server configuration
   - KVM: You must have installed KVM (Qemu) on your Linux server
          This is used for running IxNetwork VM
   - Testbed files using your environment equipments

Pre-installation:
-----------------
   1> Testbed json files in Dent testing repo
   2> Create a dent user on your Linux server
   3> Make dent user a SUDO user
   4> Create a DentCiMgmt folder
   5> Configure Linux server as a DHCP server
   6> Configure Linux server as a web server using nginx
   7> Download & install IxNetwork VM

   1> Testbed json files
      ------------------
         - You MUST have created testbed json files that reflects your environment and
	   put them under:
	      /home/dent/testing/DentOS_Framework/DentOsTestbed/configuration/testbed_config/

         - Follow examples from existing testbed json files
	 - You could optionally create your own namespace folder which groups your testbeds
	   in the testbed_config directory mentioned above

           Example:
   	      - /home/dent/testing/DentOS_Framework/DentOsTestbed/configuration/testbed_config/<my_testbeds>/dut1.json
	      - Or simply add dut1.json in the testbed_config directory

   2> Create a dent user on your Linux server
      ---------------------------------------
         - adduser dent
         - passwd dent

   3> Make dent user a sudo user
      --------------------------
         - edit: /etc/sudoers
         - add:  dent ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

   -->> AT THIS POINT, LOGOUT AND LOG IN AS dent user <<--

   4> Create a DentCiMgmt folder
      --------------------------
      - In the /home/dent directory
      - Enter: mkdir DentCiMgmt
      - Now you should have /home/dent/DentCiMgmt folder

   5> Configure your Linux server as a DHCP server
      --------------------------------------------
      You need to configure a DHCP server for IxNetwork VM to have a persistent IP address.
      The example below states the mac address 00:1a:c5:00:00:12 to listen for.
      You will use this same mac address in step #6
      The DHCP server will provide the same IP address 10.36.118.111. (Change this IP address to use your network IP)

      On Ubuntu:
         - sudo apt install isc-dhcp-serverr
         - edit /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf

	 option domain-name "testdent.dev";
         option domain-name-servers x.x.x.x, x.x.x.x; <- Use your domain server IP addresses
         option routers 10.36.118.1;

	 # Use your network IP address. This is just an example.
         subnet 10.36.118.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
	   range 10.36.118.210 10.36.118.250;
           option routers 10.36.118.1;
         }

         # This mac address is made up.  You must use this same mac address in step #6.
	 host ixnetwork {
           hardware ethernet 00:1a:c5:00:00:12;
           fixed-address 10.36.118.111;
         }

       When done editing the /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf file, exit and enter:
          [Assuming you are using Ubuntu]

          sudo systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server
          sudo systemctl enable isc-dhcp-server

   6> Configure Linux server as a web server using nginx
      --------------------------------------------------
       - cd /  (root directory)
       - sudo mkdir DentBuildReleases
       - sudo chmod -R 776 DentBuildReleases
            - It is important that the "other" user group has executable privilege
	      for installing the build on the Dent switches.

       - sudo chown -R dent:dent DentBuildReleases

       - Edit: /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

           # This path will store all Dent OS build downloads
           location /DentBuildReleases {
                root /;
           }

           # This path will store all Dent test results
	   # You could go on a web browser to view all the test results
	   # Example: http://<your ip>/TestResults
           location /TestResults {
             	# State the path to where you want the DentCiMgmt folder from step #1
                root /home/dent/DentCiMgmt;
           }

        - sudo systemctl restart nginx
	- sudo systemctl enable nginx

   7> Download & install IxNetwork VM
      -------------------------------
       As of this writing, IxNetwork version is 9.30
       You normally do not need to download/install IxNetwork
       This is only done once or twice a year and the VM must be left enabled (Never shutdown)

       - cd /home/dent/DentCiMgmt

       - mkdir IxNetworkVMs

       - Download to IxNetworkVMs folder:
             https://downloads.ixiacom.com/support/downloads_and_updates/public/ixnetwork/9.30/IxNetworkWeb_KVM_9.30.2212.22.qcow2.tar.bz2

       - Decompress file: bzip2 IxNetworWeb_KVM_xxx

       # NOTE:  The Mac address is made up. You need to use this mac address for the DHCP server to listen for in
       #        order to provide a persistent IP address
       - virt-install --name IxNetwork-9.30 --memory 32000 --vcpus 16 --disk /home/dent/DentCiMgmt/IxNetworkVMs/IxNetworkWeb_KVM_9.30.2212.22.qcow2,bus=sata --import --os-variant centos7.0 --network bridge=br1,model=virtio,mac=00:1a:c5:00:00:12 --noautoconsole

       - virsh autostart IxNetwork-9.30

       - virsh start IxNetwork-9.30

       To show the IxNetwork-VM mac address:

          Enter: virsh domiflist IxNetwork-9.30

          Interface   Type     Source   Model    MAC
          --------------------------------------------------------
          vnet15      bridge   br1      virtio   00:1a:c5:00:00:12


Installation:
-------------
   1> Git clone dentproject/testing repo
   2> Copy/paste settings.sh file in the DentCiMgmt folder and edit param values
   3> Create a symbolic link for runDentCi and ciUtils

   1> Git clone dentproject/testing repo
      ----------------------------------
      Note: The CI Automation is in the Dent testing repo in github:

      - In the directory /home/dent, enter:
            git clone https://github.com/dentproject/testing.git

   2> Create a settings.sh file
      -------------------------
      Note: The CI framework looks for a settings.sh file in /home/dent/DentCiMgmt directory
            This file contains your Linux IP address and the IxNetwork VM mac address

      - cp /home/dent/testing/CI_Automation/settingsExample.sh  /home/dent/DentCiMgmt/settings.sh

      - edit settings.sh file

      	  # Use your own IP ADDRESS!
          export DENT_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS="Your IP Address"

	  # This mac address must be the same from step #4 & #6
          export DENT_IxNETWORK_VM_DHCP_MAC_ADDRESS="00:1a:c5:00:00:12"

   3> Create a symbolic link for runDentCi and ciUtils
      ------------------------------------------------
      - cd /usr/bin
      - sudo ln -s /home/dent/testing/CI_Automation/runDentCi.py runDentCi
      - sudo ln -s /home/dent/testing/CI_Automation/ciUtils.py ciUtils

      - At this point, assuming that your Linux OS has 'python3', you
        should be able to enter runDentCi and ciUtils anywhere in your filesystem.
	If you don't have 'python3', then create a symbolic link for python3:

	   1> Get the full path to your python<version>
	      For example if the python command is python3.10, enter: which python3.10
	      output = /usr/bin/python3.10

	   2> In the /usr/bin directory, enter:
	      sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3.10 python3


Run it:
-------
    # This command will run a quick test to see if everything is working
    runDentCi -testSuite cleanConfig -testName myTest

    # After you entered the above command to run a test, use ciUtils.py to check the status
       1> ciUtils -showtests

       2> ciUtils -showstatus <testId>

       3> ciUtils -showtestresults <testId>
