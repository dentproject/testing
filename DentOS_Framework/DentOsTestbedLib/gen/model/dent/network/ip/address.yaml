          Address information
      - name: prefix
        type: ip_addr_t
        desc: |
          prefix ADDRESS (default) --- address of the interface.
          The format of the address depends on the protocol. IPv4
          uses dotted quad and IPv6 uses a sequence of hexadecimal
          halfwords separated by colons. The ADDRESS may be followed
          by a slash and a decimal number, which encodes network prefix
          (netmask) length in CIDR notation. If no CIDR netmask notation
          is specified then the command assumes a host (/32 mask) address
          is specified.

      - name: peer
        type: ip_addr_t
        desc: |
          peer ADDRESS--- address of remote endpoint for pointopoint interfaces.
          Again, the ADDRESS may be followed by a slash and decimal number,
          encoding the network prefix length. If a peer address is specified then
          the local address cannot have a network prefix length as the network
          prefix is associated with the peer rather than with the local address.
          In other words, netmasks can only be assigned to peer addresses when
          specifying both peer and local addresses.

      - name: anycast
        type: ip_addr_t
        desc: "anycast ADDRESS --- anycast address on the interface."

      - name: label
        type: string
        desc: |
          label NAME --- Each address may be tagged with a label string. In order
          to preserve compatibility with Linux-2.0 net aliases, this string must
          coincide with the name of the device or must be prefixed with device name
          followed by a colon. (ma1:duh)

      - name: scope
        type: int
        desc: |
          scope SCOPE_VALUE --- scope of the area within which this address is valid.
          The available scopes are listed in the file /etc/iproute2/rt_scopes. The
          predefined scope values are: global --- the address is globally valid.
          site --- (IPv6 only) address is site local, valid only inside this site.
          link --- the address is link local, valid only on this device.
          host --- the address is valid only inside this host.

        type: string
        desc: "dev NAME --- name of the device to which we add the address"
