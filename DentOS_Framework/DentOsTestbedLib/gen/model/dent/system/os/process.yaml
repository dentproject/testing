        Current process command line arguments.  Arguments with
        a parameter (e.g., --option 10  or -option=10) should be
        represented as a single element of the list with the
        argument name and parameter together.  Flag arguments, i.e.,
        those without a parameter should also be in their own list
        element.
    - name: start_time
      type: time_t
      desc: |
        The time at which this process started,
        relative to the UNIX epoch.  The system must be
        synchronized such that the start-time can be
        reported accurately, otherwise it should not be reported.
