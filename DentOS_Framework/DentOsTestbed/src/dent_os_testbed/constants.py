# First define the suite in PYTEST_SUITES and map the suite to a suite group in
# PYTEST_SUITE_GROUPS. And every test should belong to a test suite either
# defined with scope of test-case, class or module level.
#
# options:
# ------------------------------
# 1. @pytest.mark.suite_test : decorator can be added to testcase or a class to
# add to suite
# 2. pytestmark = [pytest.mark.suite_test] : can be added to a modele test.py
# at the top the file to add the whole module to a test suite.
# 3. pytestmark = pytest.mark.suite_test : can be added inside a class to mark
# the class to particular test_suite
#
# Note: Markers are strictly enforced,
# 1. a test case which does not belong to any suite will not be run during
# framework execution
# 2. marking with a invalid "suite_" marker will also result in pytest failing
# to run
#
# Please use prefixes "suite_group_" and "suite_" to keep markers unique and
# consistent
