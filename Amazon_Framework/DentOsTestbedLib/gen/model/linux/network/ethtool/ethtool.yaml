         -i --driver Queries the specified network device for associated driver information.
         -d --register-dump Retrieves and prints a register dump for the specified network device.
            The register format for some devices is known and decoded others are printed in hex.
            When raw is enabled, then ethtool dumps the raw register data to stdout. If file is specified,
            then use contents of previous raw register dump, rather than reading from the device.
         -e --eeprom-dump Retrieves and prints an EEPROM dump for the specified network device.
            When raw is enabled, then it dumps the raw EEPROM data to stdout. The length and offset parameters
            allow dumping certain portions of the EEPROM. Default is to dump the entire EEPROM.

            offset and value specify which byte and it's new value. If value is not specified, stdin is
            read and written to the EEPROM. The length and offset parameters allow writing to certain
            portions of the EEPROM. Because of the persistent nature of writing to the EEPROM, a
            device-specific magic key must be specified to prevent the accidental writing to the EEPROM.

             mdix auto|on|off - Selects MDI-X mode for port. May be used to override the automatic
              detection feature of most adapters. An argument of auto means automatic detection of MDI
              status, on forces MDI-X (crossover) mode, while off means MDI (straight through) mode.

              may reset the link to cause the change to take effect.
             autoneg on|off - Specifies whether autonegotiation should be enabled. Autonegotiation is enabled
              by default, but in some network devices may have trouble with it, so you can disable it if really necessary.

              hexadecimal value using one or a combination of the following values: <refer man page>
             phyad N - PHY address.
             xcvr internal|external - Selects transceiver type. Currently only internal and external can be

             wol p|u|m|b|a|g|s|f|d... - Sets Wake-on-LAN options. Not all devices support this. The argument
              to this option is a string of characters specifying which options to enable. <refer man page>

              in Ethernet MAC hex format (xx:yy:zz:aa:bb:cc).

              names the type of message to enable or disable; N specifies the new flags numerically.
              The defined type names and numbers are: <refer man page>
            The precise meanings of these type flags differ between drivers.
         -K --features --offload - Changes the offload parameters and other features of the specified
