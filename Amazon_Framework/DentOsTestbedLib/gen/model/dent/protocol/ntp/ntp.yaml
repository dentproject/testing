      ntpdate - set the date and time via NTP
      ntpdate [-46bBdqsuv] [-a key] [-e authdelay] [-k keyfile] [-o version]
        [-p samples] [-t timeout] server [...]

     members:
      - name: servers
        type: string_list
        desc: "List of servers to query from ntp"
      - name: command_options
        type: string
        desc: "Command line options"
      - name: key
        type: string
        desc: |
          Enable the authentication function and specify the key identifier to be used for authentication
          as the argument keyntpdate. The keys and key identifiers must match in both the client and server
          key files. The default is to disable the authentication function.
      - name: authdelay
        type: float
        desc: |
          -e authdelay
          Specify the processing delay to perform an authentication function as the value authdelay, in seconds
          and fraction (see ntpd for details). This number is usually small enough to be negligible for most
          purposes, though specifying a value may improve timekeeping on very slow CPU's.
      - name: keyfile
        type: string
        desc: |
          Specify the path for the authentication key file as the string keyfile. The default is /etc/ntp.keys.
          This file should be in the format described in ntpd.
      - name: version
        type: string
        desc: |
          Specify the NTP version for outgoing packets as the integer version, which can be 1, 2, 3 or 4.
          The default is 4. This allows ntpdate to be used with older NTP versions.
      - name: samples
        type: int
        desc: |
          Specify the number of samples to be acquired from each server as the integer samples,
          with values from 1 to 8 inclusive. The default is 4.
      - name: timeout
        type: float
        desc: |
          Specify the maximum time waiting for a server response as the value timeout, in seconds and fraction.
          The value is rounded to a multiple of 0.2 seconds. The default is 1 second, a value suitable for
          polling across a LAN.
