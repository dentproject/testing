          * broadcast LLADDRESS, brd LLADDRESS or peer LLADDRESS --- change
          link layer broadcast address or peer address in the case of a
          POINTOPOINT interface. Note that for most physical network devices
          (Ethernet, TokenRing, etc) changing the link layer broadcast address
          will break networking. Do not use this argument if you do not
          understand what this operation really does.

      - name: arp
        type: bool
        desc: |
          * arp on / arp off --- change NOARP flag status on the device, Note
          that this operation is not allowed if the device is already in the UP
          state. Since neither the ip utility nor the kernel check for this
          condition, you can get very unpredictable results changing the flag
          while the device is running. It is better to set the device down then
          issue this command.

          * multicast on / multicast off --- change MULTICAST flag on the device.
      - name: txqueuelen
        type: int

          * txqueuelen NUMBER / txqlen NUMBER --- change transmit queue length
          of the device
      - name: name
        type: string
        desc: |
          * name NAME --- change name of the device. Note that this operation is
          not recommended if the device is running or has some addresses already
          configured. You can break your systems security and screw up other
          networking daemons and programs by changing the device name while
          the device is running or has addressing assigned.
