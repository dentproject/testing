         -f, --force
         Does not invoke shutdown(8) and instead performs the actual action you would expect from the name.
         -p, --poweroff
         Instructs the halt command to instead behave as poweroff.
         -w, --wtmp-only
         Does not call shutdown(8) or the reboot(2) system call and instead only writes the shutdown
         record to /var/log/wtmp
         --verbose
         Outputs slightly more verbose messages when rebooting, useful for debugging problems with shutdown.
