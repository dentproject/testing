Welcome to DENT testing repository. This is the public repository for test-cases contributed by different organizations for DENT OS features.

Test cases are mixes of Functional - Features (VRF, LLDP, ACL, etc) and System Test - Integration/Interoperability tests.

Currently test cases are not tagged so you cannot see which are functional or which are system test.

Please refer to the [Doc](https://github.com/dentproject/testing/tree/master/docs) page for all details

Please feel free to suggest more separation or other types of tests.

You can also use SIT lab infrastructure to test your boxes.

Please refer the [wiki](https://github.com/dentproject/testing/wiki) section for general test documentation
