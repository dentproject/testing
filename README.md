# DENT Testing
Welcome to DENT testing repository. This is the public repository for test-cases contributed by different organizations for DENT OS features. 

Test cases are mixes of Functional - Features (VRF, LLDP, ACL, etc) and System Test - Integration/Interoperability tests.

Currently test cases are not tagged so you cannot see which are functional or which are system test.

Please refer to the Doc page for all details https://github.com/dentproject/testing/tree/master/docs

Please feel free to suggest more separation or other types of tests.

>> You can also use keysight's LaaS infrastruture to test your boxes.

Please refer the wiki section for general test documentation: https://github.com/dentproject/testing/wiki
